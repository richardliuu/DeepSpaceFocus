# Using Computer Vision to improve concentration on a task 

Should be converted to an instructions/info file at the end of the project 

# Independent Variables
1. Face Neutrality 
2. Head Stability
3. Task Engagement (could be like actions or something)
4. Eye Gaze Stability 
5. Changes in Light 

# Dependent Variables 

Concentration Score (Measured from 0-100)

# Algorithm

Concentration Score = w1(Face Neutrality) + w2(Head Stability) + w3(Task Engagement) + w4(Eye Gaze Stability) + w5(Changes in Light) 

- Some metrics are more important than others 
- w(x) represents weighted values ^^^
